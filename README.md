# DevConnect

## Description

We aspired to create something akin to LinkedIn as a job searching network and community with the goal to focus specifically on it being exclusively remote jobs. 
We created it using React, MDBootstrap, GraphQL, MongoDB, Mongoose, JWT (auth), and released it on Heroku for all to use. While it wasn't easy we were able to sufficiently reach our MVP goals 
and were able to work together as a team to overcome many of the challenges. While only being worked on for two weeks we can guarantee with more time we would truly be able to reach
the vision we had for the final outcome of this project. We may come back to this again at some point, but the functionality for a social network with even the ability to post photos is there.
